# Module Challenge #2

## Description

For this first challenge, we were tasked with taking the starter code and refactoring it to meet web accessibility standards. Given the criteria, I edited the index file so that there were fewer classes instead of every element having a class. For example, instead of ".search-engine-optimization," ".online-reputation-management", etc., I created the ".content-block" class. From there, I made sure that the styles from the mock-up still applied. I also added alt tags to the images and created a new title to better fit the content on the page. In the stylesheet, I added comments to help structure the styles listed so that whoever works on it in the future knows where to file each style.
