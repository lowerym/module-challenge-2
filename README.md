# Module Challenge #2

## Description

For this second challenge, we were tasked with creating a portfolio page using advanced HTML and CSS techniques. I based the look of the page on the original mock-up that we were provided. This includes the colors, font, content, etc. In accordance with the Acceptance Criteria, I included functionality so that the links in the navigation bar go directly to each section in the page. I also included a gallery of images, each one linking to my future projects during this course. The largest image is the first challenge I completed, and it links to the live version of that application. Also, I've edited the CSS so that the site's display changes on mobile.
